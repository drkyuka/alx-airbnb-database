# 5. Partitioning Large Tables

## Objective: Implement table partitioning to optimize queries on large datasets.

## Instructions:

<p>
    Assume the Booking table is large and query performance is slow. Implement partitioning on the Booking table based on the start_date column. Save the query in a file partitioning.sql
</p>

Test the performance of queries on the partitioned table (e.g., fetching bookings by date range).

Write a brief report on the improvements you observed.
